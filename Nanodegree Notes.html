  <div class="basebox"><h3>Web Basics</h3>
  <p>The World Wide Web was invented in the 1990s and is made up of over 30 billion pages. 
  Those pages are HTML documents. HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. Those documents 
  are linked together using HyperLinks. Within the HTML documents there can be many types 
  of files that can be accessed and downloaded which include, HTML, Plain Text, 
  Images, Videos, and Music.</p></div>

  <div class="basebox"><h3>Major pieces of the web</h3>

  <p>You, your computer and browser, the internet, and servers. Your computer sends request via the internet to servers. Those requests are sent using a protocol called http. The server responds with files that you r browser displays.</P>
  </div>

  <div class="basebox"><h3>HTML - HyperText Markup Language</h3>

  HTML is made up of:
    <ul id="HTML">
      <li>text content - what you actually see</li>
      <li>markup - what the page looks like (style)</li>
      <li>references to other documents - images, videos</li>
      <li>links to other pages</li>
    </ul>
  </div>


  <div class="basebox"><h3>HTML Markup:</h3>


  <p><b>Tags</b> - An HTML tag is always contained within angled brackets. An example of this would be
    <b><em>&lt;name> contents &lt;/name></em></b> Most tags have an opening tag (<b><em>&lt;p></em></b> for example) and a closing tag, (
    <b><em>&lt;/p></em></b>). Some tags (called "void" tags) do not require a closing tag (like the <b>&lt;br></b> tag).
    <br>

    <b>Element:</b> An HTML element refers to everything within a set of opening and closing tags.
    <br>
    <b>Attribute:</b> This is a property of an HTML element.</p></div>

  <div class="basebox"><h3>Example Tags:</h3>
  
  <ul id="Tag">
    <li><b>Bold</b> - &lt;b> contents &lt;/b></li>
    <li><em>Emphasis</em> - &lt;em> contents &lt;/em></li>
    <li>Break - &lt;br> adds a line break </li>
    <li>Paragraph - &lt;p> contents &lt;/p></li>
  </ul></div>

  <div class="basebox"><h3>HTML Attributes:</h3>
  <p>&lt;TAG ATTR = "value"> contents &lt;/TAG></p>

  <ul id="Attr">
    <li>Anchor Tag - &lt;a href="http://www.udacity.com"><a href="http://www.udacity.com">Udacity</a>&lt;/a></li>
    <li>Image tag - &lt;img> &lt;img scr = "url" alt = "text"></li>
    </ul>
    <span class="highlight">Note: Image tags do not have a closing tag. These types of tag are called <b>Void Tags</b></span></div>
  

  <div class="basebox"><h3>Inline and Block elements</h3>

  <p>An Inline element adds a new line to the end of your text. A Block element adds a text box around your text. Block elements have height and width dimensions to them. The &lt;br>, &lt;em>, and the &lt;img> tag are examples of an Inline element and the &lt;p>text&lt;/p>
    is an example of a Block element.
  </p></div>

  <div class="basebox"><h3>Span and Div</h3>
  <p>Span is Inline
  <br> &lt;span>text&lt;/span><br>
  <br> Div is Block
  <br> &lt;div>text&lt;/div></p>
  </div>

  <div class="basebox"><h3>HTML Document Structure</h3>

  <p>&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML> --- <em>This is the doctype</em>
  <br> &lt;html>
  <br> &lt;head>
  <br>
  <em><b>CSS, Javascript is entered here</b></em>
  <br> &lt;title>Title&lt;/title>
  <br> &lt;/head>
  <br> &lt;body> &lt;b>Content&lt;/b>
  <br> &lt;/body>
  <br> &lt;/html>
  </p>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="basebox"><h3>Creating A Structured HTML Document</h3>

<p><b>HTML</b> is considered the structure of the web page.
HTML is the basic language of the Web.  Like any language it t has a specific syntax and rules.
HTML uses Tags to define the structure of the web page.  
The browser interprets HTML tags into elements that form a tree.  The browser knows how 
to do this because of the DOM, (Document Object Model).  The DOM is a standard convention for 
representing and interacting with elements in HTML.  Each HTML tag creates an element 
in the DOM that the browser uses to display the page.</p>

<p>Everything in an HTML document is an element.  These elements have hierarchical relationship to each other.  They can be parent, child or sibling.  The top element is the root element.  Every element has exactly one parent except the root element.  An element can have a number of children.  Sibling elements are elements with the same parent.</p>

<div class="basebox"><h3>Coding Principles</h3>

<p>When coding your HTML webpage you should follow a few rules of thumb.  Keep your code clean and readable.  Being able to read and decipher your code is important not only to you but others as well.  This makes it eaier for making changes and fixing errors in the code.  Avoid repetition.  Being repetitive can clutter your code and makes it unreadable and puts a lot of unnessary code within the code.  Using CSS can help avoid repetition and keep your code nice, neat and clean.  You can save valuable time when avoiding repetition.  For example, instead of changing many lines of code you only need to change a few and save a lot of time.  Use meaningful tags when using css.  This is very helpful when troubleshooting your code and readability.  Test and view your code often.  This will help reduce errors in your code and cut down on layout time.  If you have an error in your code and then copy and paste it over and over again this could cause you to lose time when trying to find out where the error in your code is.  You would have to go line by line to find the error.  So by having your CSS you make your changes in one place not many.</P>

  <div class="basebox"><h3>CSS</h3> <p>(Cascading Style Sheet) is considered the style of the web page, 
  what it will look like.  CSS allows you to use a specific syntax and rules to change 
  how elements look on the page, the size of the font, the color, background, borders, 
  position, and on and on.</p></div>

  <div class="basebox"><h3>Javascript</h3> <p>This is the interactive components of the web page.</p></div>
  
  <div class="basebox"><h3>Boxify a Design</h3>

<p>If you looked at the structure of a Web page you would see that it is made up of boxes.  
  By using boxes it makes a lot easier to rearrange things if you decide to give the web page
  a different look.  When designing a web page it actually helps to start with big boxes 
  and work you rway down to the smaller boxes.  These boxes are usually defined using 
  the &lt;div>&lt;/div> tag
</p></div>

  <h2>Lesson 3</h2>
  
<div class="basebox"><h3>Adding CSS Style and HTML Structure Subtitles</h3>

<p>CSS or Cascading Style Sheets. You can have several CSS files or
sheets that will be referenced an HTML page.

With CSS the most specific rule is applied to every element.  The concept of most specific rule applied is what the word cascading means.  You keep going down and
down into the rules until you find the one that best describes the elements.  Then that rule gets applied.

Changing the visual properties of an element only changes how the element is displayed, not what kind of element it is.

Some examples of style tags are H1 and H2, H3.

CSS can be used to position elements on the web page.

One example is the flex box layout.


Flex box means flexible box and it provides an efficient way to lay out, align, and distribute space among items in a container or div.</p>

<p>A web page is a collection of boxes, in which each box contains 4 spatial components content, padding (to separate the content from the border), border, and margin (to separate the border from the adjacent boxes) . The size of the box can be set by by % or by pixel. These attributes can all be set within the HTML code or inside a CSS</P></div>
